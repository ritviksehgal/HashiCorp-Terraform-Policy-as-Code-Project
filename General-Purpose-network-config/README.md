The following is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) script created using best practices for the Google Cloud Platform. Its purpose is to demonstrate an initial set-up of a cloud enviorement on GCP.


Benefits of IaC include
1. significantly higher speed of infrastructure provisioning and configuration
2. Cost reduction and reduced staffing requirements simply by introducing automation of complex tasks.
3. Elevated accountability within infrastructure management operations as everything is documented and defined in code, making it easy to track who made the change, when, and for what reason.
